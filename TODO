TODO list for organic chemistry code:

make a general representation of carbon chains/hydrocarbons []
     make a representation of the single carbon atoms in the chain and connect them to eachother* []
     support double and triple bonds and make this automatically limit the amount of possible bonds to the carbon atom []
make a representation of functional groups []
create an abstraction for defining said groups []
use it to define common functional groups []
make a representation of organic acids []

*may be generalised later to support chains of other atoms such as Si.
